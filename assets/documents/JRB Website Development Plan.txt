JRB Website Plan

- List of items(eye list, facial list...)

- Each item has:
--name, 
--description, 
--time, 
--price,
--button "Book"

- "Book" button has to register which {'item-name'} the user clicked.


- When "book" button is clicked, user then selects a date&time. The user then has to click "Check Availability" button and it will redirect to whatsapp api with the custom message with the {'item-name'}, {'dd/mm/yy'} & {time}.
